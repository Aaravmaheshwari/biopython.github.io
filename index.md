We recently migrated from MediaWiki to GitHub pages, see our
[GitHub Pages Repository](https://github.com/biopython/biopython.github.io/)
and our
[MediaWiki-to-MarkDown migration project](https://github.com/peterjc/mediawiki_to_git_md)
for details.

The new site is mostly working, but there are a number of
[known issues](https://github.com/biopython/biopython.github.io/issues).
